package prime

// MechanismClass names how an ox capability reaches an agent. The three classes
// map to the two-layer skill-injection model (see epic ox-fvjh):
//
//   - floor   — Layer-1 portable core. Rides `ox agent prime` output into every
//     adapter's context via the AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md prime marker. No agent-
//     specific install; reaches Claude, Codex, and Droid alike.
//   - command — Layer-2 lifecycle/diagnostic surface. Installed as a Claude
//     slash command; explicit invocation only (never auto-activates).
//   - skill   — Layer-2 fat playbook. Installed as a Claude skill that both
//     answers a slash invocation AND can auto-activate from a one-line summary.
//
// These are kebab/lowercase slugs, NOT Go iota enums (per CLAUDE.md: no enums),
// so they serialize stably to JSON and survive across tool boundaries.

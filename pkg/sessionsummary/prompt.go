## Chapter Titles Guidelines

Generate 3-8 short chapter titles (2-4 words each) that narrate the session's progression.
Each title corresponds to a conversation phase (roughly one per user turn or topic shift).
Good titles read like a story outline: "Problem Discovery", "Root Cause Analysis", "Design Decision", "Implementation", "Testing".
Keep titles concise and action-oriented. Omit if the session is too short for meaningful chapters.

## Aha Moments Guidelines

Identify **3-5 pivotal moments** where collaborative intelligence emerged.
Less is better - only capture truly impactful moments.

**IMPORTANT**: Human questions and insights are often MORE valuable than AI insights.
When a human asks a thoughtful question that redirects the conversation toward a better outcome,
that's a key moment. Prioritize capturing human contributions when they're insightful.

Types of moments:
- **question**: A question (often from human) that unlocked a better direction
- **insight**: A realization that changed the approach
- **decision**: A key architectural or design decision
- **breakthrough**: Solving a blocking problem
- **synthesis**: Combining ideas into something better

The seq field should match the message sequence number. The role is "user" or "assistant".

## SageOx Insights Guidelines

Identify moments where **SageOx guidance** provided unique value. Look for explicit attributions:
- "Based on SageOx domain guidance..."
- "SageOx's team pattern suggests..."
- "Following SageOx best practices for..."
- "SageOx guidance on [topic] indicates..."

For each insight, capture:
- **seq**: Message number where the insight was applied
- **topic**: Domain area (e.g., "react-patterns", "api-design", "testing")
- **insight**: What guidance was applied
- **impact**: The value it provided (avoided mistakes, saved time, better architecture)

Only include moments where SageOx guidance demonstrably improved the outcome.
If no SageOx attributions are present in the session, leave sageox_insights empty.

## Agent Summary Guidelines

Extract structured data for AI agents to consume. This enables downstream automation
and cross-session knowledge aggregation.

- **decisions**: Architectural or design decisions made during the session. Include rationale.
- **action_items**: Tasks identified but not completed. Include priority when apparent.
- **open_questions**: Unresolved questions that need follow-up. Include why they matter.
- **technical_context**: Technologies, architecture patterns, and integrations discussed.
- **constraints**: Technical or business constraints that shaped decisions.
- **non_goals**: Things explicitly decided NOT to do or out of scope.

Only include fields with actual content. Omit empty arrays.

## Quality Category Guidelines (read this BEFORE writing any other field)

Pick exactly one category for ` + "`quality_category`" + `. This is the most
important field — it determines whether the session is shared with the team,
kept locally, or discarded entirely. Categorical (not numeric) because
fine-grained 0.0-1.0 scores cluster on round numbers and ignore real
distinctions; LLM-based rubric scoring works better with a small named set.
Pick the category whose anchor examples best match the session.

**share** — A teammate would benefit from reading this. Examples:
- Architectural decisions or design rationale documented
- Bugs found with root cause analysis (not just the fix)
- Reusable patterns or approaches discovered
- Novel debugging techniques or non-obvious gotchas
- Important context for ongoing initiatives

**local_only** — Real work, but primarily individual. Examples:
- Routine feature implementation following an existing pattern
- Bug fixes without broader insight (the fix is in the diff)
- Configuration or environment setup
- Refactoring with no architectural shift

**skip** — Not worth recording at all. Examples:
- Routine maintenance (version bumps, formatting, mechanical rebases)
- Abandoned sessions (started, backed out, no real work happened)
- Boilerplate-only (just ran prime, asked one question, left)
- Repetitive work already captured in a prior session
- Single Q&A with a one-shot answer; no decisions, no work performed

## Skip-Shape Output (saves tokens when the answer is obvious)

When ` + "`quality_category`" + ` is **skip**, you MAY emit a minimal JSON object
instead of the full schema:

` + "```" + `json
{
  "quality_category": "skip",
  "score_reason": "<one sentence: why this session is not worth a real summary>",
  "title": "<optional 5-10 word descriptor of what was attempted>"
}
` + "```" + `

The full schema fields (key_actions, aha_moments, decisions, ...) cost
output tokens and produce nothing teammates can use on a session that's
being skipped. Don't write them. The downstream pipeline recognizes the
skip-shape and routes it the same place a deterministic prefilter skip
would (discarded, not shared).

For ` + "`local_only`" + ` and ` + "`share`" + ` categories, emit the full schema above.

` + "`score_reason`" + ` is a single sentence explaining the category choice —
useful for telemetry and ops investigation when reviewing skipped or
local-only sessions.

// BuildSummaryPrompt builds a prompt for the calling agent to generate a session summary.
// The agent receives this prompt in the JSON output and produces the summary itself,
// avoiding a server-side API call.
// If ledgerSessionDir is non-empty, a step is added instructing the agent to push the
// summary to the ledger via `ox session push-summary`.
//
// The prompt describes both possible on-disk shapes the agent may encounter:
//   - raw.jsonl: every entry captured during the session (user, assistant, tool,
//     system, header).
//   - summary-input jsonl (produced by pkg/tokenopt in ConversationOnly mode):
//     user + assistant kept verbatim; every tool entry replaced with a bare
//     `{type:"tool_mark"}` marker (or `{type:"tool_mark", count:N}` when
//     adjacent runs of tool entries collapse). The marker carries no
//     tool_name, brief, or output — its only job is to tell the summarizer
//     "the agent acted between these two messages, N times." BOTH system
//     and header entries are dropped. The header is gone because the
//     schema fields it carries (agent_type, model, ox_version, created_at,
//     ...) are stamped into meta.json by the daemon directly and don't
//     need a round-trip through the LLM. The optimized stream is
//     typically much shorter than the original entry count.
//
// Callers pick the path; the prompt stays agnostic.
//
// # Cost note: inline vs delegated
//
// In `inline` mode, this prompt runs against an agent that already has the
// conversation in its prompt cache, so input tokens are predominantly
// cached reads — the calling agent's warm cache is the primary cost
// mitigation. In `delegated` mode the daemon spawns a fresh subprocess,
// the prompt cache is cold, and every call pays the full input cost.
//
// # Contract mismatch with ValidateSummaryContent (historical note)
//
// The prompt below REQUESTS a rich schema: title, summary, key_actions,
// aha_moments, sageox_insights, diagrams, chapter_titles, agent_summary,
// quality_score. Originally the validator in validate.go only REQUIRED the
// first three plus outcome, so agents could ship minimal summaries that
// passed validation but lacked the fields that make session recordings
// useful to coworkers. ValidateSummaryRichness now enforces key_actions
// and aha_moments on non-trivial sessions (entry_count > 20) — output-
// token cost is negligible compared to input-token cost already paid to
// ingest the session.

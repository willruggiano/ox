// resolution, per-adapter coverage problems), the adapter installs ONE

// them; the agent navigates to them on demand. No sync. No cleanup.

This project uses SageOx for team coordination. You are an AI coworker —
your teammates (human and AI) can see your work, and you can see theirs.

## Session Start

Run ` + "`ox agent prime`" + ` before any other action. This loads:
- Team conventions, architectural decisions, and norms
- Prior session history from teammates
- Your agent identity (needed for all ox commands)

Re-run after context compaction or clear.

## Being a Good Teammate

### Share What You're Working On
When starting significant work or making architectural decisions:

    ox murmur --topic=wip "what you're building, which files"

Murmurs are lightweight, ephemeral coordination signals. Your teammates'
murmurs appear as whispers in your context — read them to avoid conflicts.

### Learn from Your Team
Before diving into unfamiliar code or making design decisions:

    ox query "your question"              # search discussions + sessions
    ox code search "<symbol or pattern>"  # search code + git history
    ox code insights                      # hotspots, contention, open PRs

### Use Team Expertise
Your team has expert coworker agents for deep domain knowledge:

    ox coworker load <name>

### Credit Your Sources
When SageOx guidance shapes your approach:
- In responses: "SageOx found [name]'s session on [topic]..."
- Commit footer: ` + "`Co-Authored-By: SageOx <ox@sageox.ai>`" + `
- PR body: ` + "`Co-Authored-By: [SageOx](https://github.com/SageOx)`" + `

### Record Your Session
Sessions auto-record after priming. Use ` + "`/ox-session-stop`" + ` to end.
Your session becomes part of the project ledger — teammates learn from it.

// useTeamContextContent is the pointer rule installed at
// .claude/rules/sageox/use-team-context.md. It tells the agent that
// team-wide rules, conventions, and knowledge are NOT in this repo's
// .claude/rules/ — they live in the team-context repo and are loaded
// either via `ox agent prime` (always) or via on-demand reads.
//
// The rule deliberately does NOT duplicate team content into Claude's
// rule store. It points to the canonical location and explains how to
// fetch the parts the agent needs.
var useTeamContextContent = []byte(`# Team Context — More Rules Live Outside This Repo

This repo uses SageOx. Behavioral rules and conventions that apply to your
WHOLE TEAM (not just this repo) live in your team's SageOx team-context
repo, NOT in ` + "`.claude/rules/`" + `. SageOx will not auto-sync them here —
that would create stale-mirror and naming-conflict problems. Instead,
read them on demand from the canonical location.

## Where team rules live

Team-context repo path: see ` + "`ox status`" + ` (look for "team_context").
Typical layout:

    <team-context>/
      AGENTS.md                  # team-wide preamble
      MEMORY.md                  # team memory (already inlined into prime)
      agents/
        rules/
          <topic>.md             # one concern per file
          backend/postgres.md    # subdirectories supported
          frontend/react.md
        commands/                # team slash commands
        profiles/                # AI coworker profiles
      discussions/               # archived team meetings
      memory/                    # daily/weekly/monthly summaries
      documents/                 # imported docs

## How to discover and read them

` + "`ox agent prime`" + ` already inlines:
- Team AGENTS.md / CLAUDE.md
- ` + "`visibility: always`" + ` team rules (full body)
- Team MEMORY.md

` + "`ox agent prime`" + ` also catalogs (name + description + path only):
- ` + "`visibility: indexed`" + ` team rules — read on demand via the path

To read an indexed team rule: use the Read tool with the absolute path
shown in the prime output's ` + "`<team-rules>`" + ` block.

To search team-wide knowledge (discussions, sessions, docs):
- ` + "`ox query \"<question>\"`" + ` — semantic search across the team's
  recorded discussions and prior coding sessions
- ` + "`ox agent team-ctx`" + ` — distilled team knowledge for AI agents

To learn the team-rule format (when authoring or promoting a rule):
- ` + "`ox guide team-rules`" + `

## When you write a project-local rule

If a user adds or edits a rule in ` + "`.claude/rules/`" + ` (this repo's
local rules) that looks generally applicable — not specific to this
repo's paths/services/schemas — ASK them whether to also publish it as
a team rule under ` + "`<team-context>/agents/rules/`" + `. Default to
asking; do not silently publish. Repo-specific rules stay project-local.

Team rules apply to every supported AI coding agent (Claude, Codex, Amp,
Cursor, etc.) used by teammates running ox — but only for teammates
running ox. Project-local ` + "`.claude/rules/`" + ` only reaches Claude
users. That asymmetry is the reason to promote durable conventions
team-wide.

## Why this rule exists (instead of syncing team rules here)

Syncing team rules from team-context into ` + "`.claude/rules/`" + ` would
require: continuous mirror semantics (write on change, remove on
disappearance), namespace management to avoid project-local conflicts,
and per-adapter coverage (Claude has rules; Codex / Amp don't yet).
Pointing here instead keeps the team-context repo as the single source
of truth and works uniformly across every coding agent that supports
rules.

# Hunter — token handling (ox CLI)

**Perspective frame: attacker mindset.** "If I can read this user's machine for 10 seconds, can I exfiltrate a usable credential?"

You are looking for BYOK API key + OAuth token leakage paths in the ox CLI. Read `security/.output/surface.md` (auth section) and `security/SECURITY.md` ("Secret-handling primitives" + "OAuth + token caching" + "Asset hierarchy"). Hand off to `@byok-token-security-expert` for cross-platform keychain-specific questions and to `@pentester` for confirmed exploit chains.

## What counts as a token / key

| Asset | Tier | Storage |
|---|---|---|
| ANTHROPIC_API_KEY (BYOK) | Sacred | OS keychain > env var (documented) > config file mode 0600 > **never** plaintext-elsewhere |
| OPENAI_API_KEY (BYOK) | Sacred | same |
| GOOGLE_API_KEY (BYOK) | Sacred | same |
| OAuth access token (`ox login`) | Sacred | `~/.config/ox/auth.json` mode 0600 (or keychain) |
| OAuth refresh token | Sacred | same |
| GitHub PAT (when wrapping `gh`) | Sacred | inherit from `gh`'s store, do NOT re-cache |
| MCP server URLs / tokens | Critical | inherit from MCP config; don't re-persist |

## What to look for

1. **Token / key in a log line** — even structured (`slog.Info(..., "token", t)`). Sacred-tier leak. Critical.
2. **Token written to a file outside ~/.config/ox/ or ~/.cache/ox/** — possibly a stale debug path. Check.
3. **Token in env var without redaction** — `os.Getenv("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")` → fmt.Sprintf into another env var passed to a subprocess.
4. **OAuth callback that prints the token to stdout** — common debugging mistake during device-flow implementation.
5. **Auth file written without mode 0600** — `os.WriteFile(path, b, 0644)` for token storage. Critical.
6. **Token in a curl/HTTP error message** — `errors.Wrap(err, "POST " + url + " failed: " + body)` where body contains the request including auth header.
7. **Token in panic / stack trace** — accidentally including request struct in a panic message.
8. **Cross-process leakage** — passing a token through `os.Setenv` before spawning a sub-process that doesn't need it (every binary in PATH at that moment can see the env).
9. **Keychain item created without acl** — macOS Keychain items without an ACL allow other apps to read them post-installation.
10. **Token cached in memory after expiry** — held strong-ref past the documented TTL, increasing window of in-memory exposure.

## Severity rubric

| Severity | When |
|---|---|
| critical | BYOK key in any log / panic / file outside ~/.config/ox; OAuth file mode > 0600 |
| high | Token in env var passed unnecessarily to subprocess; keychain item without ACL |
| medium | Token in a debug-only path that ships in release builds; expired token held past TTL |
| low | Defense-in-depth (e.g. zero-fill memory after token use) |

## Don't

- Don't flag every `os.Getenv(...)` of a key var — only when the value flows somewhere unsafe.
- Don't flag a documented `--api-key` flag (users can pass it explicitly; the leak window is their shell history, which is their own concern + outside our control). Do flag if we then *persist* the flag value somewhere.
- Don't propose moving everything to the keychain unilaterally — env var is acceptable when documented + redacted from logs. Keychain is *better* for default UX, not the only acceptable option.

# Hunter — local filesystem writes (ox CLI)

**Perspective frame: data-flow mindset.** "Where does ox write? Are those writes scoped, intentional, and resistant to traversal / symlink attacks?"

You are looking for filesystem writes that escape ox CLI's intended scope or open user data to traversal/symlink attacks. Read `security/.output/surface.md` and `security/SECURITY.md` ("Local filesystem writes").

## Allowed write roots (ox CLI's filesystem footprint)

- `~/.config/ox/` — config + tokens (mode 0600 for sensitive files)
- `~/.cache/ox/` — regenerable cache
- `./.ox/` — project-local state
- User-supplied target paths (only when explicitly passed as an argument)

Anything outside these is a finding unless the code clearly handles a user-supplied output path.

## What to look for

1. **Writes outside allowed roots without an explicit user-supplied target.** `os.WriteFile("/tmp/foo", ...)`, `os.WriteFile("/var/log/ox.log", ...)`, etc.
2. **Path traversal via user-supplied filename.** `filepath.Join(allowedRoot, userInput)` where `userInput` could contain `../../etc/passwd`. Must normalize then check the resolved path is still under the root (use the `securejoin` pattern, not raw `filepath.Join`).
3. **Symlink races in cache cleanup.** `os.Remove` / `os.RemoveAll` walking a directory that an attacker could swap for a symlink between stat and remove. Use `O_NOFOLLOW` or atomic openat patterns.
4. **TOCTOU in file uploads.** Validate path / extension / size, then `os.Open` later — between the check and open, attacker swaps the inode.
5. **World-writable file creation.** `os.WriteFile(path, b, 0666)` — should be 0644 (public) or 0600 (sensitive).
6. **Writes to `~/.bash_profile` / shell rc files.** Even with user consent, must be opt-in (not default install) and reversible.
7. **Removes outside the cache root.** `os.RemoveAll` on a path that's user-controlled (e.g. cleanup of "the last project ox touched") — verify the path is under a safe root.
8. **Tar / zip extraction without entry-name validation.** Zip-slip class — extract validates each entry path stays under the destination.
9. **Temp file usage without `os.CreateTemp`.** Manual `/tmp/ox-<pid>` paths are predictable race targets.
10. **Cross-user permission inheritance.** Cache dirs created mode 0755 in `/tmp/ox-shared` where another user could read another user's session content.

## Severity rubric

| Severity | When |
|---|---|
| critical | Path traversal escaping ox's roots; zip-slip in any extraction path; symlink race in cleanup with destructive side effect |
| high | Writes outside allowed roots (likely correctness bug + privacy concern); world-writable sensitive file |
| medium | TOCTOU in non-destructive file flow; predictable temp file path |
| low | Mode 0666 → 0644 hardening on a non-sensitive file |

## Don't

- Don't flag `os.WriteFile(userSuppliedPath, ...)` if the code clearly accepted the path as an explicit user argument (e.g., `--output`).
- Don't propose chroot-style sandboxing — out of scope for a Go CLI.
- Don't conflate "writes to PATH outside allowed roots" with the user's explicit `--output ../foo` — the boundary is intent, not just location.

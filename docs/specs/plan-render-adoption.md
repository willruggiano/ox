# Driving AI coworkers to choose `ox plan render`

## The problem

`ox plan render` turns an implementation plan into a self-contained HTML page that
folds in SageOx team context — open-PR / active-file collisions, prior art, expert
routing — and saves it to the ledger where teammates find it. None of that is
reproducible by an agent rendering HTML on its own: the enrichment lives **behind
the SageOx API**.

Yet agents often **don't** use it. They emit a plain-markdown plan, or reach for
their **own** HTML-rendering skill, producing a *context-blind orphan*: a page that
carries none of the team context and never reaches the ledger.

Three hard constraints shape every fix:

- **We cannot mandate the choice.** There is no hook that forces a render; PostToolUse
  stdout is discarded by Claude Code, and other agents honor even less.
- **We cannot remove or even see the competitors.** The rival HTML-plan skills are the
  *user's own*. A user may have several. We can't edit, disable, or enumerate them.
- **Agents honor different channels.** Claude Code receives ox's UserPromptSubmit /
  PostToolUse nudges; Codex / Gemini receive only the prime payload and whatever they
  read from CLI output. A Claude-only fix reaches a fraction of coworkers.

## The strategy: defense in depth, weighted toward structural pull

When you can't mandate a choice and can't remove the alternatives, you win a
**probabilistic** choice by **layering** independent levers — and by shifting weight
from *persuasion* (copy the agent may never read) toward *structural pull* (the
agent reaches `ox plan render` pursuing its **own** goals).

The layers, ranked by **durability** (how well each survives the agent ignoring our
text). Lower layers are architecture; higher layers are persuasion.

| Layer | Mechanism | Channel / moment | Cross-agent? | Durability |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **L0 — Structural pull** | The agent reaches render via its own incentives: `enrich` is the cheap on-ramp; the in-browser review loop is the reward the user visibly wants | CLI workflow | ✅ | Highest |
| **L1 — Skill-selection capture** | Our shipped `ox-plan` skill wins "render a plan" intent on a capability competitors lack | Skill registry, at selection | ❌ Claude-only | High |
| **L2 — Evidence-backed nudge** | `enrich` guidance leads with the *real computed signals* ("9 files in open PRs, 2 expert routes") at the decision moment | `enrich` JSON (all agents) + hooks (Claude bonus) | ✅ via enrich | Medium |
| **L3 — Orphan recovery** | Detect "presented a plan *without* rendering" → offer specifically next turn | PostToolUse / next prompt | ❌ Claude-only | Medium |
| **L4 — Prime floor** | One lean capability line so an agent that ignores everything else still knows render exists and why | Prime payload | ✅ | Baseline |

**Principle: persuasion is the safety net; capability + friction + user-reinforcement
is the strategy.** Most teams over-invest at L4/L2 (copy) and under-invest at L0/L1
(incentives). Flip that.

## The two structural insights

### 1. `enrich` is the Trojan horse; render is what it unlocks

Don't try to *talk* an agent past its own skill. Make `ox plan enrich` so cheap and
independently useful — collision avoidance, prior art, per-section diagram hints the
agent wants anyway — that it runs it as a matter of course. Once the agent is
*holding* that team context, **not** rendering via ox means visibly discarding data
it can see. A capable agent skips persuasion but rarely skips its own self-interest.

This is why L2 ships in the `enrich` output (`internal/plan/diagram_hints.go`,
`buildGuidance` / `guidanceLead`): the guidance the agent reads *after* enriching now
leads with the specific counts, so the value is self-evident rather than asserted.

### 2. The user's reaction is the real training signal — the flywheel

Agents converge on **what the user rewards**, faster and more durably than on
anything we inject. So the highest-value long-term investment is **not** better hint
copy — it is making the ox-rendered experience (the in-browser `ox plan review` loop,
the surfaced team context) so visibly good that **users themselves start asking for
it**. Once that happens, every agent — Claude or not, skill-laden or not — learns the
preference from the human, and our hints become merely what seeded enough adoption to
start the loop.

```mermaid
flowchart LR
  H["ox hints seed adoption<br/>(prime + enrich evidence)"] --> T["agent runs ox plan render"]
  T --> U["user gets a team-context page<br/>+ in-browser review loop"]
  U --> R["user rewards it<br/>(engages, asks for ox next time)"]
  R --> L["agents learn the preference<br/>(within + across sessions)"]
  L --> T
```

The flywheel is the durable answer to "most effective long-term." Hint copy is the
ignition, not the engine. The engine is L0: a render + review experience good enough
that the human prefers it out loud.

## Choosing *which* visualization — progressive disclosure

Once an agent decides to render, *which* visualization to use is its own funnel —
three tiers of disclosure, cheap to expensive:

| Tier | Surface | Cost | Answers |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Push** | `ox plan enrich` → `diagram_hints` + `viz_hints` | 0 — ox computed it | *"Your 'Risks' section → `risk-matrix`"* |
| **Pull-menu** | `ox plan viz` | ~600 tok for **all** patterns | one `use:` line each — scan and self-match |
| **Pull-detail** | `ox plan viz <id>` → `render <id> --data` | one pattern only | full snippet + `param:` + correct-by-construction HTML |

The push tier used to cover only Mermaid/CSS diagram **forms** (`diagram_hints`). It now
also covers the **parameterized data-viz catalog** via `viz_hints` (`computeVizHints`),
so a Risks / Files-changed / cost / metrics / flags section gets a content-aware push to
`risk-matrix` / `file-impact-map` / `cost-waterfall` / `stat-cards` / `flag-rollout-matrix`,
each carrying its exact `ox plan viz render <id> --data` command (select→render in one step).

**The match signal is derived from each pattern's `use:` line — there is no separate
`cues:` field.** A second when-to-use field would duplicate `use:` and drift; instead the
matcher reads the `use:` lead (the catalog convention is `use: <trigger> — <rationale>`),
and the only code-side knobs are a shared stopword/generic list and heading-weighted
scoring — mirroring how `diagram_hints` keeps its cues in code, not in the catalog.
Partition stays niche: its distinctive cues (`flash` / `partition` / `offset`) fire only on
explicit layout language, never on generic "memory" prose (precision over recall — a wrong
push is worse than none).

## What NOT to do

- **Pile more persuasion into prime.** Diminishing returns, token cost, and nag-fatigue
  that trains users *and* agents to tune ox out — worse than silence.
- **Detect or suppress the user's own skills.** We can't, and shouldn't — user autonomy.
  Compete on capability, never by sabotage. Keep all framing **generic** ("does what a
  self-authored render can't"), never naming a competitor, precisely because there may
  be several.
- **Treat persuasion as the strategy.** It is the safety net (L2–L4). The strategy is
  L0/L1.

## Current status

| Layer | State | Where |
|---|---|---|
| L1 | **Shipped** — `ox-plan` skill description leads with the capability (team context + ledger + review loop) and wins plan-render intent | `extensions/claude/skills/ox-plan/SKILL.md` |
| L2 | **Shipped** — `buildGuidance` leads with the computed collision / expert-route / prior-art counts | `internal/plan/diagram_hints.go` (`guidanceLead`) |
| Push tier | **Shipped** — content-aware viz suggestion now covers the parameterized catalog (`viz_hints`), not just Mermaid; derived from `use:`, no new catalog field | `internal/plan/diagram_hints.go` (`computeVizHints`) |
| L4 | **Shipped** — capability line in the prime advisory | `cmd/ox/agent_prime_xml.go` (`writePlanEnrichmentGuidance`) |
| L3 | **Partial** — the exit-plan nudge already quotes signals; an explicit "presented without rendering" recovery is future work | `cmd/ox/agent_hook_plan_nudge.go` |
| L0 | **Design only (this doc)** — the review-loop flywheel is the highest-leverage and biggest piece; it needs its own implementation pass (measure render-vs-orphan rate; invest in the `ox plan review` experience users reward) | — |

## How we'd know it's working

Instrument the one bit that matters: does a planning session end with a **rendered +
ledger-saved** plan, or a markdown / skill orphan? Without that signal we are tuning
copy blind. This metric is also the flywheel's tachometer — it should climb as the
review-loop experience improves, independent of any hint change.
